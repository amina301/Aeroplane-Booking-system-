✈️ Aeroplane Booking System

The **Aeroplane Booking System** is a simple C++ console-based project that simulates basic airplane seat booking. Users can reserve seats by entering their name, age, and passport number. The system prevents double booking and displays all confirmed reservations. It's a great project for beginners learning C++ and is ideal for academic assignments or practice.

### ✅ Key Features

* 📥 Book seats using passenger details
* 🔐 Prevents double booking of the same seat
* 📋 View all booked passengers
* 💡 Easy-to-use text menu
* 📚 Structured, beginner-friendly code

---

### 🧠 How It Works

* Allows booking a limited number of airplane seats
* Stores each passenger’s information in a structured array
* Offers a simple loop-based menu to book or view bookings
* Ensures each seat is only booked once

---

### 🔮 Future Scope

This project can be expanded to simulate more real-world scenarios:

* Add seat **cancellation or rebooking options**
* Store bookings in **files or databases**
* Support **multiple flights** with different seat maps
* Add **date/time scheduling**
* Implement **login systems** for admin/passenger roles
* Create a **graphical user interface (GUI)**

---

### 🌟 Future Benefits

* 📈 **Scalability**: Can be scaled into a full-fledged airline reservation system
* 🧑‍💼 **Real-world Simulation**: Builds a strong foundation for real-time booking apps
* 💼 **Portfolio Project**: Great for showcasing C++ and problem-solving skills on GitHub
* 🏫 **Academic Use**: Can be extended for final year or diploma projects
* 🧠 **Learning Tool**: Helps understand core C++ concepts like structures, arrays, and conditionals
* 🔧 **Customizable**: Easy to modify for buses, trains, or movie seat bookings
